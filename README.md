# II2260 Embedded System
Here's my repository for II2260 - Embedded System Course. It mostly stores the code for II2260 project


## Tutorial for setting up the Enviroment
Things that you need to do :

1. Download Arduino IDE ( you can download that through https://www.arduino.cc/en/software )
2. Setting up the Arduino IDE for ESP32 because Arduino IDE by default only compatible with Arduino. 
      - After you open the Arduino IDE, click File -> Preferences
      - Fill the Additional Board's Manager URL's with this link https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json . Then click OK
      - Click Tools -> Board -> Boards Manager
      - Type ESP32 and install the latest version of ESP32 Library
3. Install the driver for Micro-usb. You can download that through https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers?tab=downloads

Note that not all Micro USB can send data through its cable :D
